## 🚀 Junior Software Developer | Full-Stack Developer

👋 Hi! I'm **Ashwani**, a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** currently working as a **Junior Software Developer**.

I enjoy creating clean, scalable solutions and collaborating with teams to deliver reliable and maintainable systems.

I’m looking to collaborate on **full-stack or open-source projects**, especially those involving real-world workflows, performance optimization, or enterprise-level systems.

I’m looking for help with **advanced .NET Core concepts**, backend performance tuning, and writing clean, scalable React code.

I’m currently learning **system design concepts and modern backend practices** to strengthen my full-stack skill set.

Ask me about **full-stack development**, debugging production issues, or writing optimized logic in **C & C++**.

Fun fact: I enjoy breaking complex problems into simple solutions—it’s my favorite part of coding.
